**AUVs** are self-contained submersibles. Their architecture includes a pressure hull (often with syntactic foam for buoyancy), thrusters for motion, and internal electronics (CPU, batteries) sealed inside. Navigation sensors (gyro/IMU, pressure/depth sensor, Doppler Velocity Log, sonar, cameras) and payloads (e.g. samplers) are integrated into the hull. The figure below (SeaBED AUV) labels typical subsystems.

**ROVs** consist of a *surface system* and the *subsea vehicle*, connected by a tether (umbilical). The surface system includes the topside control console, computers, and power supply. The tether carries electrical power and data (and sometimes fiber optics) down to the ROV. The ROV unit contains thrusters, cameras, lights, sensors, and any tools/manipulators, as well as its own onboard CPU.

Modern ROVs (e.g. VideoRay Pro 4) use a rugged PC on the surface and a high-speed digital bus.
