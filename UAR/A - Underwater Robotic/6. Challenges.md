Key underwater robotics challenges include:

- **High Pressure:** ~1 atm per 10â€¯m depth; deep-sea robots need strong pressure hulls.
- **Limited Sensing/Communication:** EM waves don't travel well underwater; acoustics are used.
- **Navigation Uncertainty:** Dead-reckoning leads to drift; acoustic beacons or surfacing needed.
- **Energy Constraints:** AUVs are battery-powered; energy efficiency is vital.
- **Environmental Hazards:** Saltwater corrosion, biofouling, currents, terrain, entanglement risk.
